name: "Cliffside Ascent"
tier: "1"
type: "Traversal"
description: "A steep, rocky cliffside tall enough to make traversal dangerous."
impulses: "Cast the unwary down to a rocky doom, draw people in with promise of what lies at the top"
difficulty: "12"
potential_adversaries: "Construct, Deeproot Defender, Giant Scorpion, Glass Snake"
feats:
 - name: "The Climb - Passive"
   desc: "Climbing up the cliffside uses a Progress Countdown (12). It ticks down according to the following criteria when the PCs make an action roll to climb:\n\n  - Critical Success: Tick down 3\n  - Success with Hope: Tick down 2\n  - Success with Fear: Tick down 1\n  - Failure with Hope: No advancement\n  - Failure with Fear: Tick up 1\n\n  When the countdown triggers, the party has made it to the top of the cliff.\n\n  *What strange formations are the stones arranged in? What ominous warnings did previous adventurers leave?*"
 - name: "Pitons Left Behind - Passive"
   desc: "Previous climbers left behind large metal rods that climbers can use to aid their ascent. If a PC using the pitons fails an action roll to climb, they can mark a Stress instead of ticking the countdown up.\n\n  *What do the shape and material of these pitons tell you about the previous climbers? How far apart are they from one another?*"
 - name: "Fall - Action"
   desc: "Spend a Fear to have a PC’s handhold fail, plummeting them toward the ground. If they aren’t saved on the next action, they must make a roll; tick up the countdown by 1, and they take 1d12 physical damage if the countdown is between 8 and 12, 2d12 between 4 and 7, and 3d12 at 3 or lower.\n\n  *How can you tell how many others have fallen here before? What lives in these walls that might try to scare adventurers into falling for an easy meal?*"
