   desc: "There has been a battle here. A PC can make an Instinct Roll to identify evidence of that fight. On a success with Hope, learn all three pieces of information below. On a success with Fear, learn two. On a failure, a PC can mark 3 Stress to learn one and gain advantage on the next action roll to investigate this environment. A PC with an appropriate background or Experience can learn an additional detail and ask a follow-up question about the scene and get a truthful (if not always complete) answer.\n\n  - Traces of a battle (broken weapons and branches, gouges in the ground) litter the ground.\n  - A moss-covered tree trunk is actually the corpse of a treant.\n  - Still-standing trees are twisted in strange ways, as if by powerful magic.\n\n*Why did these groups come to blows? Why is the grove unused now?*"
