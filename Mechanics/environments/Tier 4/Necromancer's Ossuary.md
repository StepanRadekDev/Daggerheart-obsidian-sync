feats:
 - name: "No Place for the Living - Passive"
   desc: "A feature or action that clears HP requires spending a Hope to use. If it already costs Hope, a PC must spend an additional Hope.\n\n  *What does it feel like to try to heal in a place so antithetical to life?*"
 - name: "Centuries of Knowledge - Passive"
   desc: "A PC can investigate the library and laboratory and make a Knowledge Roll to learn information related to arcana, local history, and the Necromancer’s plans.\n\n  *What are the names of the tomes? What project is the necromancer working on and what does it communicate about their plans?*"

What bones stick in your armor?*"

Do the undead look more lifelike or, paradoxically, are they more decayed but vigorous?*"
 - name: "They Just Keep Coming! - Action"
   desc: "Spend a Fear to summon 1d6 Rotted Zombies, two Perfected Zombies, or a Zombie Legion, who appear at Close range of a chosen PC.\n\n  *Who were these people before they became the necromancer’s pawns? What vestiges of those lives remain for the heroes to see?*"
